# Generating a Dataset of Natural Language Swarm Descriptions and corresponding Robot Controllers

# Installation
For installing [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is recommended.
Poetry can be installed with `pipx install poetry`, assuming [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is installed. Pipx can be installed using most package managers or with `python -m pip install --user pipx`. Make sure to execute `pipx ensurepath` after installation.

Run scripts like `hatch run python scripts/generate_data.py`. You may need to deactivate active conda environments on windows.
